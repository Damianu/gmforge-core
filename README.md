# How to start testing your code

#### Testing on the development Server
If you are just building a quick little applet, you can do live testing on the development server

To start testing your code, simply go to the development server @ www.gmforge.io, log-in and access the 'mod tools'

#### Testing on your local GM Forge server

In order to get your new code running, you must first concatenate your modified 'Scripts' folder together into a single file, 'core.js'. 

#####TODO Write out how to concatenate your files

Once you have concatenated the files, overwrite the 'core.js' file in your /public/bin folder.

Once you have overwritten the changes, simply refresh using ctrl+R, or restart your server, and you will be able to see the newest changes.

# This Readme is a WIP (Obviously)
I am doing my best to expand it! Lend me some support https://www.patreon.com/gmforge so I can spend the proper amount of time documenting and explaining how to do things!
