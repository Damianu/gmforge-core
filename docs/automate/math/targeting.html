  <h2>What are Dice Actions?</h2>
  <p>
    Dice actions refer to clicking a dice roll directly in chat to apply a certain calculation. These are
    programmed according to the game you are playing, but can be modified with relative ease in the system builder.
  </p>

  <h4>Targeting Actors</h4>
  <p>
    You can target an actor (or actors) by selecting them on a map, clicking on them in the combat tracker, or clicking on the 'targeting' in the top left of the actor's sheet.
  </p>

  <h4>Performing Dice Actions</h4>
  <p>
    Once you have targeted an actor (or actors) you can click on a dice roll and apply the action by selecting one of the options. This will change the character depending on the action (best used for applying damage or repetive math calculations).
    You can also drag a dice roll directly onto an actor's sheet, and it will prompt you to perform a dice action.
